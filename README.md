# Smart-Shoe
# Smart Shoe for Visually Impaired

## Overview
An innovative assistive technology project aimed at enhancing mobility and independence for visually impaired individuals. This smart shoe uses Arduino-based technology to detect obstacles and provide tactile feedback to the wearer.

## Key Features
- **Obstacle Detection**: Utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to identify obstacles within a 15cm range.
- **Tactile Feedback**: Employs a vibration motor to alert the wearer of detected obstacles.
- **Arduino-Powered**: Built on the Arduino Uno platform for reliability and ease of modification.

## Project Evolution
1. **Initial Prototype**: 
   - Used Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensor, and buzzer for auditory alerts.
   - Implemented basic obstacle detection functionality.

2. **Current Version**:
   - Replaced buzzer with a vibration motor for tactile feedback.
   - Eliminated breadboard for a sleeker, more comfortable design.
   - Enhanced effectiveness in various environments, including noisy areas.

## Technical Improvements
- Addressed noise pollution concerns by switching from auditory to tactile alerts.
- Streamlined the design for improved comfort and aesthetics.
- Demonstrated iterative problem-solving in assistive technology development.

## Future Development
- Exploring power optimization techniques for extended battery life.
- Investigating integration with smartphone apps for additional features.
- Seeking collaborations to further refine and potentially commercialize the product.

## Contribution
This project is open for contributions. Feel free to fork, submit pull requests, or open issues for suggestions and bug reports.
